/**
 * @page mcu_at_console_page MCU wrapper: AT CMD console
 *
 * This console is used to communicate At commands and responses with the device.
 * Depending on your application need, it could be based on UART link, I2c and so on.
 *
 * **Reception**
 *
 * On reception side, this wrapper should handle incoming ASCII character as a data stream.
 * The client of this wrapper should register a callback which will be invoked each time a new
 * character is received.
 *
 * **Transmission**
 *
 * On transmission side, it is possible to send strings on same base as classic printf fucntion.
 * A specific API is also available to send the content of a binary buffer. It shold convert binary
 * data into ASCII printable strings.
