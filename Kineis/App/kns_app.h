/**
 * @page kns_app_page APP task
 *
 * This page is presenting Two APPlication task example which exercices the Kineis stack SW
 * (\ref KNS_APP) in a way to send user data to the Kineis network..
 *
 * Two applications tasks are available:
 * * A standalone app (\ref KNS_APP_stdln_loop) is sending one user message (4 retransmit each 60s)
 * * A GUI app (\ref KNS_APP_gui_loop) is dedicated to communicate with the Kinéis Device Interface
 * (KDI) through AT commands (\ref mgr_at_cmd_page) over an UART link (9600 bauds, 8, N, 1).
 *
 * Those application needs some configurations from user such as:
 * * Credentials (ID, ADDR, Secret key)
 * * Radio configuration (UL frequency and modulation)
 * * Kineis protocol configuration (a.k.a. MAC profile)
 * Refer to "getting started" section for details.
 *
 * In case of GUI APP, the format of an AT command is like:
 * * "<pattern>=?\r\n" (e.g. "AT+PING=?\r\n") to get information
 * * "<pattern>=<params>\r\n" (e.g. "AT+TX=<user_data>\r\n") to set information
 * The list of supported AT commands is available through \ref cas_atcmd_list_array.
 *
 * Communication between tasks (APP and MAC) in done through events posted in OS Queues.
 * By the end, those applications shows how to:
 * * Invoke the kineis stack to send USER DATA
 * * Wait notification from the Kineis stack once the transmission is completed

 *
 * This application is posting some send-data event to MAC layer of Kineis software stack in loop as

 *
 * Depending on the defined MAC protocol:
 * * BASIC: APP is trying to send 2 data at start but kineis stack can only accept the first one.
 * This data is sent once only, then is goes into lowpower mode.
 * * BLIND: APP is trying to send 5 data at start but 4 are accepted. Each data is re-transmitted
 * (retx) several times periodically as per the configuration of the protocol. Once a data is fully
 * transmitted, APP will try to send a new data again.
